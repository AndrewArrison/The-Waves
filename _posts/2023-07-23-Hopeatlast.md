#Hope at last.

He found light in the darkness. As he knows the world is rude but kind. There was a time when love ruled the world, now money runs it. After all, everything still needs to be loved. He never felt love. Not from his mother, father, or brother. Human instinct is, when you don't get what you want they look for it everywhere. He believed love was something under the skin, the soul as people call it. Very long search it was. Finally found someone, with everything he ever wanted "Pure Heart".

Who knows someone more than a friend? For the first time, he chooses friendship with someone he loves. Time flows like a river, it waits for nothing. As time went by they became closer and closer. Close to fire is never good, it burns you. He taught her how man thinks, and she taught him how women think. At a point, he confessed his love. She was already in love with someone else. Love makes everyone blind, not able to see what he wanted she fall more and more for him. He had already taken her for granted and teared her like trash, as told love makes everyone blind.

But He never would let his loved one get hurt. So he convinced her to let go of that someone. Time flows again. She also said that she like him too. He believed that she loved him, the light burned bright than ever. He had hope more than any time in his life. Being loved is what a man needs from the inside, and respect from the outside. Not a single person in the whole world can say what is the plan of GOD in heaven. From nowhere silence started to walk with them, and slowly she started moving apart.

He tried to talk to her, but every time she said everything but the truth. As said no person in the whole world can say what God needs. At last, the silence broke apart, She said what had to told."I only need him, no one else" small words it was but heavy as mountains. He sank into deeps of sadness that left him speechless. He could have used a thousand combinations of all 26 letters to try to make things right. After all that will only make things worst so he goes on in silence. He know from the beginning that he was the one who destroyed something for something new. For him, it was good, others bad. At last, he told himself "To love is to let go".Nothing in his life would have hurt like that. A scare that won't be healed, not because she left him only because he doesn't know if it was his fault or the reason.
