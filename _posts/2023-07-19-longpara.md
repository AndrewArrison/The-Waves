He found light in the darkness.As he know thw world is rule but kind.There was a time when love ruled thw world, now money runs it.After all everything still need to be loved.He never felt love.Not from his mother, father nor brother.Human instinct it is, when you dont get what you want they look for it everywhere.He belived love was something under the skin, soul as people call.Very long search it was.Finally found someone, with everything he ever wanted "Pure Heart".
